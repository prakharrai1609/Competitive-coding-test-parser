# ✔ Sublime test parser
This is a test parser which can automatically parse the tests in from websites like codeforces, codechef, atcoder etc.

## ✔ Why did I make sublime test parser?
1. Most sublime users use a 3 column layout (source.cpp, input.txt, output.txt) file for competitive programming. 
2. Their was no test parser which can generate the test cases inside input.txt itself.
